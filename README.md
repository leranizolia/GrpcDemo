# GrpcDemo

The mini-project was implemented within the framework of acquaintance with grpc according to the lesson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyxCX2GYHxk. The client and the server sides are done in one project but they don`t know about each other and communicate via the proto. This implementation was chosen for convenience.

Clone the repository and start the project in your IDE.

Thank you for the attention!
